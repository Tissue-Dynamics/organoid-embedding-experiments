# Final Data Summary - With Control Wells

## Key Discovery
The 29,524 "empty drug name" wells are actually **control wells** (concentration = 0), not missing data!

## Final Dataset

### After Proper Analysis:
- **19 high-quality plates** (>300h duration AND >50% usable wells)
- **6,648 total wells**
  - 1,528 control wells (23.0%)
  - 5,120 treatment wells (77.0%)
- **183 unique drugs**

### DILI Distribution (in treatment wells):
- DILI positive: 2,768 wells (54.1%)
- DILI negative: 952 wells (18.6%)
- Mappable drugs: 1,400 wells (27.3%) - need drug name standardization

## Data Quality Improvement

### Original Analysis (incorrect):
- Thought we had only 3,968 usable wells (9.8%)
- Excluded all empty drug names as "bad data"

### Corrected Analysis:
- **38,272 usable wells** (94.1% of all data!)
- Only 2,384 wells (5.9%) truly need exclusion

### Usable Data Categories:
1. **Control wells** (31,328) - concentration = 0
2. **Valid drug wells** (4,968) - drugs already in metadata
3. **Mappable drug wells** (1,976) - need name standardization

## Drug Mapping Needed

The file `drug_mapping_to_edit.csv` contains drugs that need mapping:
- Drug variants with ".1" suffix (e.g., "Tamoxifen.1" → "Tamoxifen")
- Different formulations (e.g., "Copanlisib tris-HCl" → "Copanlisib")
- Well positions in parentheses (e.g., "Bortezomib (A09)" → "Bortezomib")

## Recommendations

1. **Use the 19 high-quality plates** for analysis (6,648 wells)
2. **Edit drug_mapping_to_edit.csv** to recover the 1,400 mappable treatment wells
3. **Keep all control wells** - they're essential for normalization
4. **Document that empty drug names = controls** for future reference

This dataset is more than sufficient for:
- DILI prediction modeling
- Time series analysis
- Embedding generation
- Statistical validation

The balance of controls (23%) to treatments (77%) is ideal for proper experimental analysis.

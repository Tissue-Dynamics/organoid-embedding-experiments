# Remaining Data Summary

## Overview

After applying data quality exclusions, the remaining dataset is significantly reduced:

### Key Numbers:
- **3,968 wells** remaining (9.8% of original 40,656)
- **16 plates** remaining (47.1% of original 34)
- **123 drugs** with valid data

## Detailed Breakdown

### Original Dataset
- 40,656 total well records
- 34 plates
- ~1,196 wells per plate average

### After Exclusions
- **Wells excluded**: 36,688 (90.2%)
  - 34,992 due to drug name mismatches
  - 3,164 in excluded plates
- **Plates excluded**: 18 (52.9%)
  - 12 flagged for quality issues
  - 6 with no valid wells after drug exclusions

### Remaining Data Quality

**Plate characteristics:**
- Duration: 326-1,125 hours (all >300h minimum)
- Average duration: 447 hours (18.6 days)
- Wells per plate: 182-383
- All have proper media change events

**Drug distribution:**
- 123 unique drugs (from original 208 in metadata)
- DILI+ drugs: 76.6% of wells
- DILI- drugs: 23.4% of wells
- Good representation of both categories

## Implications

The 90% data loss is primarily due to:

1. **Empty drug names** (29,524 wells - 72.6% of all wells)
2. **Drug name variants** (.1 suffixes, different formulations)
3. **Control conditions** not in drug metadata

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Recover Some Data
- Standardize drug names (remove .1 suffixes)
- Map control conditions (DMSO, Ctrl) appropriately
- Could potentially recover ~5,000-10,000 wells

### Option 2: Use Current Clean Dataset
- 3,968 wells is still substantial for analysis
- Data quality is high (no ambiguous drugs)
- 16 plates with complete experimental cycles
- Good DILI+/- balance (77%/23%)

### Option 3: Investigate Empty Drug Names
- 29,524 wells have no drug assigned
- These might be:
  - Control wells that should be labeled
  - Data entry issues
  - Wells that should be excluded

The current clean dataset of 3,968 wells across 16 plates should be sufficient for:
- DILI prediction modeling
- Embedding analysis
- Feature extraction
- Statistical validation

However, recovering the wells with standardizable drug names could significantly increase the dataset size.

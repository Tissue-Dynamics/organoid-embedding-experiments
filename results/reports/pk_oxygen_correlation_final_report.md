# PK-Oxygen Correlation Analysis: Final Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis of 61 drugs revealed significant correlations between oxygen-derived features and both PK parameters and DILI outcomes.

## Key Correlations Identified

### PK Parameters
- **Cmax**: Correlates with early temporal response patterns
- **Half-life**: Correlates with O2 variability and temporal changes
- **LogP**: Correlates with lipophilic accumulation at high concentrations
- **Protein Binding**: Correlates with control baseline responses

### DILI Outcomes
- **Control baseline** (r=0.27): Higher baseline associated with DILI risk
- **Global variability** (r=-0.26): Lower CV associated with DILI risk
- **Temporal ratios**: Distinguish between DILI categories

### Polynomial Features
- Nonlinear combinations improve correlation by 20-50%
- Interaction terms capture synergistic concentration effects
- Response magnitude Ã— direction products most predictive

## Clinical Implications

1. **Baseline Assessment**: Control well responses predict DILI risk
2. **Variability Analysis**: Consistent toxicity more concerning than variable
3. **PK Integration**: Clinical exposure essential for interpretation
4. **Nonlinear Models**: Complex dose-response requires polynomial features
5. **Temporal Dynamics**: Recovery patterns more predictive than peak effects

## Recommendations for Model Development

- Incorporate PK-normalized features (response/Cmax ratios)
- Use polynomial combinations for nonlinear dose-response
- Weight temporal dynamics over static endpoints
- Consider baseline variability as risk stratification factor
- Validate findings on external datasets with clinical outcomes

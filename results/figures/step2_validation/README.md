- **Row 2**: catch22 time series features (4 representative features)
- **Row 3**: SAX symbolic features (entropy, transitions, complexity, dominance)
- Color-coded by window size (24h, 48h, 96h)

### 7. `catch22_feature_heatmap.png`
**catch22 feature analysis**
- **Left Panel**: Feature correlation matrix (22x22)
- **Right Panel**: Normalized feature values across samples
- Shows feature relationships and value distributions

## üîç Key Validation Points

### ‚úÖ **Rolling Windows Working Correctly**
- 50% overlap implemented properly
- Window boundaries align with step sizes (12h, 24h, 48h)
- Complete temporal coverage achieved

### ‚úÖ **Feature Extraction Robust**
- catch22 features extracted successfully (100% success rate)
- SAX hierarchy captures different pattern resolutions
- Error handling and fallbacks working

### ‚úÖ **Data Quality Maintained**
- Appropriate number of data points per window
- Actual window durations match expected durations
- No systematic biases observed

### ‚úÖ **Feature Diversity Achieved**
- 80 features per window providing rich representation
- Statistical (basic) + time series (catch22) + symbolic (SAX)
- Hierarchical SAX showing increasing complexity/detail

## üéØ **What This Validates**

1. **Technical Implementation**: Rolling windows, feature extraction, error handling
2. **Scientific Rigor**: Proper SAX methodology, catch22 integration, temporal scales
3. **Data Pipeline**: End-to-end processing from raw data to structured features
4. **Scalability**: Architecture ready for full 10,930 wells dataset

## üöÄ **Next Steps Ready**

With these validations confirmed, the pipeline is ready for:
- **Full Dataset Processing**: Scale to all 10,930 wells
- **Step 3 Implementation**: Media change event detection
- **Dose-Response Analysis**: Hill curve normalization
- **Cross-Drug Comparison**: Multi-drug feature analysis

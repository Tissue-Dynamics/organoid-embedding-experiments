# Potential Preprocessing Pipeline Improvements

This document outlines specific improvements that could enhance the current preprocessing pipeline for liver organoid oxygen time series data. These recommendations are based on analysis of the existing codebase and its limitations.

## Current Pipeline Overview

The existing pipeline processes ~7,680 time series from 240 drug treatments through:
1. Data loading and filtering (is_excluded=false)
2. Time alignment to "hours from drug start"
3. Media change correction
4. Normalization (various strategies)
5. Hierarchical aggregation (wells → concentrations → drugs)

## Identified Limitations and Proposed Improvements

### 1. Media Change Correction Enhancements

**Current Limitations:**
- Assumes uniform shift magnitude across all wells
- Uses simple median signal detection with fixed 2-hour window
- No consideration of drug-concentration interactions with media changes
- Fixed significance threshold (p<0.05) without multiple testing correction

**Proposed Improvements:**
```python
# Drug-specific media change detection
def detect_drug_specific_shifts(data, drug_id, concentration):
    """
    Detect media changes with drug/concentration-specific parameters
    - Use robust statistics (MAD instead of mean/median)
    - Model shift magnitude as function of concentration
    - Apply temporal smoothing to avoid over-correction
    - Validate correction quality by comparing pre/post segments
    """
    
# Adaptive correction based on local signal characteristics
def adaptive_media_correction(segment, reference_segments):
    """
    - Learn correction parameters from similar concentrations
    - Use Bayesian approach to estimate shift magnitude
    - Preserve biological signal while removing artifacts
    """
```

### 2. Improved Concentration Aggregation

**Current Limitations:**
- Simple averaging loses variance information
- No outlier detection before aggregation
- Equal weighting regardless of data quality
- No measure of replicate consistency

**Proposed Improvements:**
```python
# Robust aggregation with uncertainty quantification
def aggregate_with_confidence(well_embeddings, quality_scores):
    """
    - Calculate median and MAD for robust central tendency
    - Weight by data quality scores
    - Return confidence intervals/standard errors
    - Flag inconsistent replicates
    """
    
# Outlier detection before aggregation
def detect_replicate_outliers(embeddings, method='isolation_forest'):
    """
    - Use unsupervised outlier detection
    - Consider biological replicates as cluster
    - Preserve outliers for separate analysis
    """
```

### 3. Enhanced Time Alignment

**Current Limitations:**
- Crude hourly binning with potential data loss
- No quality assessment of interpolated regions
- Fixed 300-hour window may truncate data
- Alignment to MIN(timestamp) not actual treatment start

**Proposed Improvements:**
```python
# Biological constraint-aware interpolation
def bio_constrained_interpolation(time_series, method='pchip'):
    """
    - Ensure monotonicity where expected
    - Limit rate of change to biological plausibility
    - Quality score for each interpolated point
    - Handle edge cases (start/end of series)
    """
    
# Flexible time window handling
def adaptive_time_windows(experiments):
    """
    - Determine optimal window per drug
    - Align to actual treatment start (not first measurement)
    - Handle variable-length experiments gracefully
    - Preserve late-stage effects in long experiments
    """
```

### 4. Comprehensive Quality Metrics

**Current Limitations:**
- Binary pass/fail quality assessment
- Same criteria for all drugs
- No biological plausibility checks
- Limited temporal quality assessment

**Proposed Improvements:**
```python
# Multi-level quality scoring
def hierarchical_quality_score(time_series, drug_metadata):
    """
    Quality dimensions:
    - Temporal consistency (smooth vs noisy)
    - Biological plausibility (range, rate of change)
    - Technical quality (gaps, interpolation extent)
    - Drug-specific expectations
    
    Return: 
    - Overall score (0-1)
    - Dimension-specific scores
    - Actionable quality flags
    """
    
# Drift and artifact detection
def detect_technical_artifacts(time_series):
    """
    - Sensor drift detection using detrending
    - Calibration shift identification
    - Anomaly detection in measurement patterns
    - Plate edge effects
    """
```

### 5. Dose-Response Aware Normalization

**Current Limitations:**
- Treats each concentration independently
- No consideration of dose-response relationships
- Time-invariant normalization
- Control drift not accounted for

**Proposed Improvements:**
```python
# Hierarchical dose-response normalization
def dose_response_normalization(concentrations_data):
    """
    - Fit dose-response curve (e.g., Hill equation)
    - Normalize relative to fitted curve
    - Preserve relative potency information
    - Account for biphasic responses
    """
    
# Time-varying baseline correction
def temporal_baseline_correction(time_series, control_series):
    """
    - Model control drift over time
    - Use sliding window for local normalization
    - Robust to control outliers
    - Preserve drug-induced dynamics
    """
```

### 6. Additional Advanced Features

#### Batch Effect Correction
```python
def correct_batch_effects(data, batch_info):
    """
    - Use ComBat or similar methods
    - Preserve biological variation
    - Account for nested batch structures
    - Validate correction effectiveness
    """
```

#### Temporal Feature Engineering
```python
def extract_dynamic_features(time_series):
    """
    Features to extract:
    - Rate of change at different time scales
    - Time to plateau/steady state
    - Recovery dynamics post-media change
    - Oscillation characteristics
    """
```

#### Uncertainty Propagation
```python
def propagate_uncertainty(data, processing_steps):
    """
    - Track confidence through pipeline
    - Monte Carlo sampling for robust estimates
    - Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty
    - Report final embedding confidence
    """
```

2. **Hold-out Validation**: Reserve drugs for testing improvements
3. **Biological Validation**: Check dose-response preservation
4. **Stability Testing**: Ensure reproducibility
5. **Performance Metrics**: Compare clustering/embedding quality

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize improvements based on impact and effort
2. Create proof-of-concept implementations
3. Validate on subset of data
4. Gradually roll out to full pipeline
5. Document changes and parameters

These improvements would significantly enhance the reliability and biological interpretability of the liver organoid time series embeddings, leading to more meaningful drug characterization and toxicity predictions.
